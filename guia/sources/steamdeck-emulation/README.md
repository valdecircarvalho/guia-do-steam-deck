Steam Deck Emulation Guide

This guide covers how to install emulators on a Steam Deck, setting up controls, playing games with optimal settings, and integrating them into Steam itself. It uses [Steam ROM Manager](https://steamgriddb.github.io/steam-rom-manager/), which automatically downloads cover art for each game and adds a shortcut to Steam. The end result will look like this, with Steam collections for each system:

**This is an unofficial guide**, not affiliated with Valve or any of the emulator developers. To my knowledge, it's not possible to mess up your Deck from this guide, but I take no responsibility if you do. This guide **does not** cover getting ROMs or other copyrighted material.

### Storage

This guide assumes your ROMs are under `~/roms` (a folder in your home directory), with a file structure like this:

```
roms
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ switch
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wii
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gamecube
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ n64
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ snes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ps2
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 3ds
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ds
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ psp
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pce
```

### SD Cards

If you store your roms on an SD card, substitute `~/roms` with `/run/media/mmcblk0p1/roms` in each guide. You'll have to give each Flatpak access to your SD card. Open up a terminal and run

```bash
flatpak override <emulator> --filesystem=/run/media/
```

Substitute `<emulator>` with the emulator's Flatpak name (specified in each guide). For example, Snes9x's Flatpak name is `com.snes9x.Snes9x`, so you'd run

```bash
flatpak override com.snes9x.Snes9x --filesystem=/run/media/
```

## Getting Started

To start off, switch to Desktop mode by pressing the **Steam** button, navigating to **Power**, then **Switch to Desktop**.

Open Firefox, then navigate to [Steam ROM Manager's latest release](https://github.com/SteamGridDB/steam-rom-manager/releases/latest), and download the file ending in `.AppImage` that **DOES NOT** contain `i386`. It should be named something like `Steam-ROM-Manager-2.3.40.AppImage`.

Open SteamOS' file manager Dolphin (it's different from the emulator Dolphin), then navigate to wherever you saved the file, probably in **Downloads**. You can run it by just double-tapping the file. If prompted for Steam's directory, enter `/home/deck/.local/share/Steam`.

From here, the guide branches off for each system you want to emulate:

-   [Nintendo Switch](./emulators/yuzu.md)
-   [GameCube and/or Wii](./emulators/dolphin.md)
-   [Nintendo 64](./emulators/simple64.md)
-   [SNES](./emulators/snes9x.md)
-   [PC Engine (CD) / TurboGrafx-16 (-CD) / SuperGrafx](./emulators/mednaffe.md)
-   [PlayStation 2](./emulators/pcsx2.md)
-   [Nintendo DS](./emulators/melonds.md)
-   [Nintendo 3DS](./emulators/citra.md)
-   [PlayStation Portable (PSP)](./emulators/ppsspp.md)

## ‚ö† Common Issues

-   If you've successfully performed the setup steps for an emulator but you get a blank screen when booting a ROM, the emulator may not have access to your ROMs directory. Open a terminal and run `flatpak override <name> --filesystem=~/roms` to allow it to find your ROMs. Replace `<name>` with the Flatpak name found in the guide for the emulator.
