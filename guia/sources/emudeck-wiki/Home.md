# What the *hell* is EmuDeck anyways?
EmuDeck is an installation script that helps you get started with emulation on the Steam Deck. It is not an all in one solution like some other software. Instead, it strives to provide the best possible official options to you, set up and ready to go. 

Install Emulators?   Done for you. Software is either installed from the available Software Store (Discover), or directly from the Emulators official repositories.

Folder Structure?    Ready to roll. We've made an Emulation folder with folders for your BIOS files and ROMs.

Hotkeys?    Yup. Where possible these are consistent. By the nature of there being lots of different programs here sometimes we need Steam Input Profiles to get these going.

Settings?    We've done our best to optimize every emulator for the deck. You can certainly tweak stuff, but it's recommended to do so with per-game settings.

Emulator Updates?    These are available in the Discover store, the EmuDeck `Tools & Stuff` Menu, or by re-running the EmuDeck installer.

Could you do everything EmuDeck does on your own? You sure could, but now you don't have to.

# General Usage:

1.  To begin with EmuDeck, please download and run the installer from the main page at www.emudeck.com.
2.  Updates are handled by simply running EmuDeck again.
    1. You can find EmuDeck on your desktop: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/196099299-afb63d83-5434-4822-bd6c-8d93d76cadcf.png" height="60"> 
    2. We recommend allowing EmuDeck to reset your general emulator configurations on each update, in order to be up to date with the latest optimizations. To make changes, we recommend making per-game settings. These will not be overwritten by updates. 
3.  If you would like to customize your install, please choose `Custom Mode` during the installer.
    1. A Breakdown of Custom Mode: https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#demystifying-custom-mode
4. After you run EmuDeck once, re-open EmuDeck to use the `Tools & Stuff` menu for additional configuration. 
    1. A Breakdown of the `Tools & Stuff` Menu: https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#demystifying-the-tools-and-stuff-menu
5.  We have included a tool to update emulators outside of the Discover Store. Use it any time you want to update CEMU, EmulationStation-DE, PCSX2-QT, Ryujinx, Steam ROM Manager, Vita3K, and Yuzu.
    1. You can do so on the `Tools & Stuff` Menu: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/196100096-e9c4114b-7eaf-49cd-93d0-1fca35048bcb.png" height="300">
6.  If you come across something where you feel that the configurations should be updated, please create an issue: https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/issues and we will get back to you shortly!
    1. We can't promise it will be a bug-free experience. Please report any bugs you come across by submitting an issue on the GitHub page.

Setup Required:
Many emulators require BIOS files. Generally place them in the `Emulation/bios` directly with no subfolders. There are a few exceptions. You can check the cheat sheet for more information, https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/Cheat-Sheet.

Please note - we cannot help you obtain ROMs, BIOS files, or any other copyrighted files; and none are provided to you in the EmuDeck install.
