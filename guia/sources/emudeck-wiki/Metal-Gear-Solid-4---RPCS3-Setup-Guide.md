### THIS GUIDE IS FOR STEAM DECK RPCS3 USING EMUDECK



# THIS PAGE IS OUTDATED HERE IS THE LINK TO THE PAGE THAT IS BEING UPDATED (https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/community-creations#metal-gear-solid-4) 


### ~~**NOTE:** This guide is just to set up MGS4 and getting it ***RUNNING WITHOUT CRASHING*** on Steam Deck, much work is still needed to get it working with an optimized playable configuration free from audio issues and framerate hitching. This page is still a work in progress and will updated as better configuration options are determined~~

# ~~Getting MGS4 running on steam deck with rpcs3~~

~~MGS4 when first imported into RPCS3 will freeze natively and needs some work to get functioning.~~

~~I believe trying to patch the file using the built in RPCS3 patch manager will not fix the issue and the game needs to be patched manually to get it working. (Let me know if anyone else is able to prove otherwise)~~

### ~~1. If you haven't done so already, follow the PS3 setup guide from RGC to get mgs4 added and rpcs3 setup~~
- ~~https://retrogamecorps.com/2022/10/16/steam-deck-emulation-starter-guide/~~



### ~~2. Patch using the "Manually adding custom patches" section on this page and the MGS4 patch section in the second link. (You can make the patch yourself using the rpcs3 wiki link or download the one I have made from my github repo linked just below)~~
- ~~https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Help:Game_Patches#Using_game_patches~~
- ~~https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=Help:Game_Patches/Canary~~

~~Link to premade manual patch:~~ 
~~https://github.com/agasbarro36/MGS4-RPCS3-Manual-Patch~~


### ~~3. When the instructions say "Save the file in relevant location:" you need to navigate to save it in the flatpack location instead of the usual Linux one.~~
~~The location is:~~
	~~`~/.var/app/net.rpcs3.RPCS3/config/rpcs3/patches`~~



### ~~4. Open RPCS3 Navigate to the Patch Manager (Select Manage > Game Patches) and tick the checkbox corresponding to the patches you wish to apply.~~
* ~~Select Metal Gear solid 4: Guns of the Patriots in the game list and click the tab to expand~~
* ~~expand both tabs for the version of the game you have~~
*  ~~select the `cellspurs urgent commands hack - 4.8x` (where 'x' is the ps3 firmware version you installed)~~
*  ~~select `Crash Fix`~~
*  ~~select `Disable Shadows`~~
*  ~~select `Disable spawned effects`~~
*  ~~select `Reduce Stage quality`~~
*  ~~select `Unlock FPS`~~

### ~~5. Apply and Save your patch settings then run the game~~

***


~~The game takes ~2 hours to install initially so be ready for a long wait~~
	
~~I recommend adding all the patches to boost performance as much as possible. This game is really hard to run so you need all the help you can get.~~
	
~~These are just the settings I got to work, maybe mess around with it and let me know if something works better and I can update this guide.~~ 
	
~~Good luck out there, this game will work now albeit running kinda like trash, there's a lot of frame inconsistencies and audio either cutting out or missing altogether but it is technically able to be played (though I would not consider it above the threshold of "playable") I think the results are promising and with some community tweaking we can get this masterpiece to generally playable state on steam deck.~~
