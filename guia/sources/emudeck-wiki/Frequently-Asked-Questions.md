## Why won't EmuDeck download?
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

Internet issues are an increasingly common issue among Steam Decks, even if your internet works perfectly fine on other devices, or you have the latest and fastest internet. You may notice that EmuDeck isn't installing properly, or is taking a long time time to install. You may notice these same internet issues when you try to browse the internet or download a game and the internet speeds are much slower than you would expect. 

You can fix these issues by adjusting your DNS, in System Settings within Desktop Mode, in `Configure Network Settings`. 

**Here's How:** 

1. Click the bottom left icon in the taskbar (Steam Deck icon), click `Settings` in the list, open `System Settings`.
2. Click `Connections` on the left.
3. On the `IPv4` tab, change the `Method` to `Automatic (Only Addresses)`.
4. In the `DNS Servers` box, enter `1.1.1.1`.
5. Click the `IPv6` tab at the top, change the `Method` to `Disabled`.
6. For good measure, restart your Steam Deck.

**Visual Reference:** <img src="https://github.com/rawdatafeel/Emudeck-GIFS/blob/main/GIFs/How%20to%20Configure%20Internet%20Settings.gif?raw=true" height="400">

**Note:** If the above steps still do not fix the issue for you, you can try switching to a 2.4 GHz WiFi network if your ISP provides you with one.

## Where do I get ROMs?
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

Legally, ROMs must be obtained from your console. Various emulator websites have guides on how to dump games. Other methods are piracy and cannot be discussed here or on the EmuDeck Discord.

## If I install EmuDeck, will it clutter my Steam library?
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

No! EmuDeck is a "dumb" script that installs a suite of tools and emulators to your Steam Deck. One tool that EmuDeck installs is "Steam ROM Manager", a tool that allows you to add ROMs as non-Steam game shortcuts to your library. You are not required to use Steam ROM Manager.

EmuDeck also installs EmulationStation-DE, a front-end that manages all of your ROMs within a single app. You may choose to use either Steam ROM Manager, EmulationStation-DE, both, or neither of them. EmuDeck is simply a script, and how you choose to use its installed suite of tools and emulators is up to you. 

After you have installed EmuDeck, you can use Steam ROM Manager and select which parsers you would like to use. You can use the `Emulationstation-DE` parser and the `Emulators` parser to add EmulationStation-DE and EmuDeck's installed suite of emulators to your Steam library. Adding emulators to your library allows you to tweak settings directly in Game Mode. Turning on other parsers will add the respective system's ROMs to your library. Learn how to generate and save an app list here: https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/steam-rom-manager#how-to-generate-and-save-an-app-list. 

**Read:** https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#getting-started-with-emudeck, for a list of the tools and emulators EmuDeck installs.

**Tutorials (Pick one)**

**Preface:** These tutorials require you to turn on `sshd`. If you decide to enable `sshd`, make sure to use a strong password. If you do decide to use a weak password, do not use your Steam Deck on public wifi without turning `sshd` off first. 

Do one of the following options to disable `sshd` (not necessary until after you've completed one of the three tutorials below):

* Enter this command: `sudo systemctl disable sshd --now` to disable it 
* Install `System Toolbox`, a plugin for Deckyloader (refer to https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#how-do-i-install-power-tools-and-deckyloader on how to install Deckyloader). You can use the QAM ("...") button to disable `sshd` in `Game Mode`

## How do I transfer my initial install of EmuDeck to my SD Card and Vice Versa?
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

### Preface

When you install EmuDeck, EmuDeck prompts for an install location, either the SD Card or the Internal SSD. This install location contains the directory for your ROMs, BIOS, and storage files. Regardless of the location you choose, EmuDeck will install its suite of emulators and tools onto your internal SSD. 

However, you may decide to buy an SD Card and want to move that install location from your internal SSD to your SD card. Or you may want to move all of your files back to the internal SSD. 

**Here's how:**

***

### Transferring from the Internal SSD to SD Card

_Note: If you haven't already, format your SD card in game mode._
1. Switch to Desktop Mode.
2. Locate the `/home/deck` folder, right click the `Emulation` folder, click cut.
   1. You will not see `deck` in the file path, this folder is the `home` folder for the user, `deck`.
3. Open the SD card, right click, press paste. 
   1. To locate this file path, either: 
   2. Open Dolphin (file manager), click Primary on the left.
   3. Open Dolphin (file manager), click rootfs on the left, follow this path, `/run/media/SDCARDNAME/`
       1. Your SD Card may be named: `mmcblk0p1`
4. Open `EmuDeck` on your desktop. If you don't have this shortcut, you can also re-download it from EmuDeck's website: http://www.emudeck.com/.
   1. Visual Reference: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/196099299-afb63d83-5434-4822-bd6c-8d93d76cadcf.png" height="60"> 
5. Re-run the EmuDeck installer, choose Custom Mode. 
   1. This installer will not delete any of your files. The EmuDeck installer is designed to be re-run.
6. Select your SD card. 
7. When you reach the `Emulators for Steam Deck` page on the EmuDeck installer, make sure to select everything that you used previously to ensure that all of your emulators and tools are properly configured with your SD Card.

## How do I change the Steam Input Controller Profile?
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

### Preface 

EmuDeck comes with a few Steam Input profiles to make hotkeys easier to use in a few emulators. If an emulator does not have a Steam Input Profile, make sure you're on `Gamepad with Joystick Trackpad`, otherwise some controls may not work.

EmuDeck comes with Steam Input Profiles for the following emulators:

* Duckstation
* Cemu
  * The Steam Input Profile is necessary to switch screens
* Citra
  * The Steam Input Profile is necessary to switch screens
* PPSSPP

### Changing Steam Input Profiles

In Game Mode, single click the game you would like to change the Steam Input Profile for, and click the `Controller Icon` on the right of the screen. Click the layout (whatever name it is currently set to) at the top, and you will see a drop-down menu. When playing a PSX, 3DS, or Wii U Game, switch to the respective Steam Input Profile.

For a visual, watch the following GIF (Duckstation is being used as an example):

## How to Verify ROMs
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

### How to Verify a ROM Successfully Transferred 

Sometimes, data loss or corruption can occur when you transfer ROMs to your Steam Deck. You can verify that the ROM successfully transferred by checking its MD5 Checksum. An MD5 Checksum is a 32-character hexadecimal number that is computed on a file. If the MD5 checksum on both the file on the Steam Deck and the original PC is an exact match, the file transferred successfully. If they do not match, the file is potentially corrupt. You will need to correct or adjust how you transfer files. 

**Here's How**

**On the Steam Deck**

1. Right click the ROM
2. Click Properties
   1. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/210105434-0ed44a57-c686-462b-afe9-a5ea52faeab3.png" height="300">
3. Click the Checksums tab
4. Click `Calculate` to the right of `MD5`
   1. Wait, it may take a few moments
   2. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/210106031-f77bd8ef-c0ab-44df-8603-75a502f81934.png" height="300">

**On the non-Steam Deck PC**

* **Windows:** 
   * Download: https://github.com/gurnec/HashCheck/releases
   * Instructions: https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@wangwenjing/how-to-use-hashcheck-in-windows
* **Mac:** https://ss64.com/osx/md5.html
* **Linux (Command-line):** https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/md5sum.1.html

### How to Verify a ROM is Valid

For one reason or another, your ROM may be corrupt and may not work properly. One way to confirm that you have a valid ROM is by comparing it to the ROM page on [redump.org](redump.org). Redump is an internet community "dedicated to collecting precise and accurate information about every video game ever released". You can validate your ROM by comparing its MD5 Checksum, a 32-character hexadecimal number that is computed on a file, to the MD5 Checksum on [redump.org](redump.org). 

**Here's How**

#### How to Find your MD5 Checksum

**Note:** `Vampire Night`, for the Playstation 2 is being used as an example in the below guide. 

1. Right click the ROM
2. Click Properties
   * <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/222926543-2411c324-fd05-43db-91ae-0842bcc7989c.png" height="300">
3. Click the Checksums tab
4. Click `Calculate` to the right of `MD5`
   * Wait, it may take a few moments
   * <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/222926493-df0a8680-ba47-497c-a372-25905943d412.png" height="300">
   * Note down the MD5 Checksum for the next section

#### How to Compare your MD5 Checksum to Redump

1. Open redump.org, and search for your ROM 
   * For example, Vampire Night's page: http://redump.org/disc/13152/
2. Note down the MD5 Checksum on the redump.org page and compare it to your ROM
   * Using Vampire Night as an example:
        * MD5 Checksum on the ROM: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/222926493-df0a8680-ba47-497c-a372-25905943d412.png" height="300">
        * Redump's MD5 Checksum: <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/222926621-b1b64ee7-0ed4-4a37-b22c-109c851bd836.png" height="300">
3. The Vampire Night ISO MD5 Checksum matches to the MD5 Checksum on the redump page, meaning the ROM is valid

## Why is my emulator or game muted?
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

There is no one known reason why an emulator or ROM (run through an emulator) can accidentally be muted. However, the fix is simple.

**Tutorial**

1. In Desktop Mode, open the emulator
   * Example: If you are playing a PS2 ROM, open PCSX2
2. Either temporarily turn off the `Start in Fullscreen` feature or make sure you have a way to use `Alt` + `Tab`
   * You can bind `Alt` + `Tab` to a back bumper, plug in a keyboard, or use Anydesk to switch out of the emulator
3. Launch a game
4. In the taskbar, press the audio icon, select the `Applications` tab, in the list, you should see your emulator with a muted speaker icon
   * <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/216749000-600e9792-4f15-449f-9eaf-aba6bc0c6465.png" height="300">
5. Click the speaker icon to unmute the emulator
   * Make sure to turn fullscreen back on if you turned it off
6. This fix applies to any game you launch through that emulator

## How do I navigate to my SD Card through an emulator's menu?
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

For some emulators, you may need to navigate to your SD Card to install updates/DLC or locate a file of some sort for the emulator. On Linux, your SD card is a file path, so navigating there through the menu will look different. 

**Using Yuzu as a Reference:**

1. Open Yuzu.
2. Click `Files`, `Install files to NAND`.
3. Click `Computer` on the left.
4. Your SD Card path is `/run/media/mmcblk0p1`.
   1. `mmcblk0p1` is the default name of the SD Card when formatted by the Steam Deck.
5. You will now see your `Emulation` folder and you can proceed to locate your files. 

For some emulators, you may need to click `Other Locations` first before seeing `Computer`.

## Why are my emulators stuttering? How do I improve emulator performance?
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

There may be a number of reasons for this, but your first debugging tool should be to ensure that both the frame limiter and the refresh rate are off. Consider turning off half rate shading if you had it previously on. Half rate shading may cause visual glitches as well. 

To find these options, press the QAM ("..." button), press the battery icon, press advanced view. 

**Note:** It's a good idea to use per game profiles if you intend on changing any of these settings.

## How do I install Power Tools and Deckyloader?
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

### Preface

Deckyloader is a plugin manager, used in `Game Mode`. `Power Tools` is a plugin for Deckyloader that allows you to use additional power settings in the QAM (`...` button).

**Why use Power Tools?** 

Power Tools can negate stutters in many emulators (Including Citra, Dolphin, PCSX2, and Yuzu). In the Power Tools menu, you can turn off SMT, which reduces the amount of threads the Steam Deck uses, allowing for increased performance. 

Deckyloader's Website: https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader

Power Tools Website: https://github.com/NGnius/PowerTools

**An Explanation of Power Tools:** 

> The Steam Deck has a 4 Core and 8 threads CPU. A thread refers to multi threading. Multi threading in turn refers to virtual cores, which can handle two tasks per core. 
> In game mode, the Steam Deck spoofs that it has a 8 core CPU, so a game can spawn more multi threaded jobs. If the game is optimized for more multi-threading jobs, it can be more energy efficient. 
> Turning SMT off in Power Tools is the equivalent of turning multi threading off, which allows the CPU to become a 4 core CPU with 4 threads. This reduction allows for jobs to hit less cores which means that the clock curve clocks them higher, due to a higher load. As a result, the four cores are less energy efficient because the cores are higher clocked. In some emulators, turning off SMT leads to better performance.


***

### Installing Deckyloader and Power Tools

## Where Did Steam ROM Manager Go?
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

The latest EmuDeck update removed all of its shortcuts from your desktop except for EmuDeck itself. These shortcuts included: Steam ROM Manager, an Emulator Updater, and an uninstaller.

The current update moves all of these icons directly into EmuDeck itself. After you run the new EmuDeck update for the first time, open it again, and you will find a `Tools & Stuff` button at the bottom. In this menu, you can open Steam ROM Manager as usual.

In addition to the above, you will also find Steam ROM Manager as a shortcut in the bottom left menu, in desktop mode (Steam Deck icon).

## Help, I just opened Steam ROM Manager and I have no controls!
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

When you open Steam ROM Manager, it will exit out of Steam. Since your controls are tied to Steam being open, your controls will revert to `Lizard Mode`. You can use `L2` to right click, `R2` to left click, and the `Right Trackpad` to move the mouse.

Alternatively, you can either use a mouse/keyboard (Bluetooth or through a USB-C Hub) or remote into your Steam Deck.

# Common Words and Acronyms
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

**Common Words**

* Log
  * A log file is a computer-generated data file. When you install EmuDeck, a log is automatically created recording general information about the install, errors, or any problems that may have occurred during the install. The log contains important information about each pieces of the EmuDeck install. The EmuDeck log can be found here: `/home/deck/emudeck/emudeck.log`

* MD5
> MD5 works by taking pieces of the original file(the number of pieces overall is not important), applying mathematical functions to it, and adding the result to the hash. When all of the blocks have been processed, your final hash is the result.

> Because of the design of MD5, a change in any block, no matter how small, is propogated to the other blocks during the hashing process. So even a single bit change is going to effect the hash.

> MD5 does have some rare occasions where two different files produce the same hash. However, these occasions(called collisions) are very very rare. 

***

**Common Acronyms**

* ROM 
  * A software image of read-only memory, of a game cartridge, used in emulation. Commonly used for ISOs as well. 
* BIOS
> BIOS is actually an acronym standing for Basic Input/Output System. It is a term used to refer to the set of computer instructions that are built into the system which initialises the hardware when it's switched on.

> At a very basic level, emulators 'pretend' to be the system that they are emulating. In order to do this, they must still "initialise" the fake hardware so that the Operating System/Program (in this case, the game you're playing) - can still access stuff like the buttons, speakers and the screen in order to make things happen.

> The emulator acts as a go-between: it accepts the game's commands to the original hardware, translates it into something your current hardware can interpret, and back again. For example: play a sound or music, draw a character to screen, or accept your input from pressing buttons.

## Understanding What You Are Using
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

### EmuDeck

EmuDeck is the installer. It installs "stuff" for you, including emulators, EmulationStation-DE, Steam ROM Manager, and a few other tools. 

### Front-Ends

EmulationStation-DE and Steam are the two primary front-ends that you can use to launch your ROMs. Steam ROM Manager adds your ROMs to Steam, or you can launch your ROMs entirely from EmulationStation-DE. EmulationStation-DE and the shortcuts created by Steam ROM Manager in Steam are not typically directly related to the settings configured in the emulators. 

For example, if you are running a Gamecube game through a shortcut created by Steam ROM Manager or EmulationStation-DE, you are still using the Dolphin emulator to run that Gamecube game. You are not running the Gamecube game through Steam, EmulationStation-DE, or EmuDeck. Steam (through Steam ROM Manager created shortcuts) and EmulationStation-DE are two front-ends that launch your game for you, but, have little to no relation to the actual execution of the game. That is all dependent on the emulator being launched by these two front-ends.

### Emulators

Using a front-end like Steam shortcuts created by Steam ROM Manager or EmulationStation-DE means you are launching an emulator. If you have issues while in game, typically you want to debug what is going on with the emulator.

For a full list of emulators installed by EmuDeck and their associated websites: https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#what-does-emudeck-install

Let's run through a few examples.

### Examples

**Debugging Using Incomplete Information**

* "I am using EmuDeck to launch my games."
    * Remember, EmuDeck is only an installer. Once it finishes installing its suite of emulators and tools, it has no bearing on the actual launching of the ROM or the emulator.

* "I am using EmulationStation-DE to launch my games."
   * The front-end can be helpful information to include and should be included when you're requesting support or understanding how to debug your game. However, you also need to understand what EmulationStation-DE is specifically launching, to then open your game. If you are playing a Gamecube game, EmulationStation-DE is launching the Dolphin emulator to play that Gamecube game. 
   * If you understand what emulator your ROM is using, then you can try opening that emulator on its own to see if the emulator can provide additional feedback on what may be wrong with the ROM. 

**Debugging Using Somewhat Complete Information**

* "I am using EmulationStation-DE to launch my games. I am trying to open a Gamecube game (Dolphin emulator), Super Mario Sunshine, through EmulationStation-DE, but it is not launching."
   * This provides a lot more information, but to fully debug what's going on, you will want to try launching your ROM through the emulator, in addition to the front-end. You can either use Steam ROM Manager to add emulators to Game Mode or you can launch emulators in Desktop Mode (make sure to hold the start button to switch between desktop and gamepad configurations) and test your ROM from the emulator directly. For the most part, emulators can provide important error messages that can alert you to what's specifically wrong with your ROM.

**Debugging Using Complete Information**

* "I am using EmulationStation-DE to launch my games. I am trying to open a Gamecube game (Dolphin emulator), Super Mario Sunshine, through EmulationStation-DE, but it is not launching. I tried opening Dolphin, in Desktop Mode, to play my ROM and Dolphin said my ROM was corrupt."
   * This rounds out working through each aspect of what you are using to launch your ROM and provides you with information that can be used to debug what's going on. In some cases, you may not have set the emulator up fully (in the case of Yuzu, Ryujinx, and RPCS3), and need to read through documentation to fully set up the emulator before you can start playing.

## Debugging Using Steam Shortcuts
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

Testing shortcuts created by Steam ROM Manager in a terminal can provide you with output information. This information may be valuable in debugging specifically what's wrong with your ROM, in the case of corruption/file error, or some sort of setting gone awry in the emulator. 

***

### Retrieving the Steam Shortcut

1. In `Desktop Mode`, open `Steam`
2. Select the game you are debugging
3. Click the `Gear` icon
   1. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/212619919-ec4c720a-64bc-47fe-8265-3447e1e7c735.png" height="300">
4. Click `Properties`
5. Copy the `Target`, `Start In`, and `Launch Options` fields entirely
   1. The `Launch Options` field may be blank, skip it if it the box is empty
   1. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/212620245-87056dcf-0e1d-462a-a58b-adfd57739e09.png" height="300">
6. In the taskbar, click the `Steam` icon in the bottom left to open the Applications Launcher, open `Kate`, or a text editor of your choice
7. Paste the `Target`, `Start In`, and `Launch Options` fields here
   1. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/212620438-2758b7b5-6a82-40a5-a7ae-441347028fd1.png" height="300">
8. Using the Shortcut:
   * If you are receving support through EmuDeck's Discord or Subreddit, take a photo of the shortcut in `Kate`, using your phone or however you usually take photos and share it with the person providing you support
   * If you are debugging on your own: https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions/#if-you-are-debugging-on-your-own

### Using the Steam Shortcut

Pick one of the below:

#### If You Are Receiving Support through EmuDeck's Discord or Subreddit

1. Take a photo of the shortcut in `Kate`, using your phone or however you usually take photos
   - You can zoom in to make it easier to read
2.  Share it with the person providing you support

#### If You Are Debugging On Your Own

1. Paste the command into `Konsole`  
   - If you are using RetroArch, add a `-v` before the `-L` in the shortcut
   - Example: 
   - Original Shortcut: `"/usr/bin/flatpak" run org.libretro.RetroArch -L /gambatte_libretro.so "/run/media/mmcblk0p1/Emulation/roms/gb/Super Mario Land (World) (Rev 1).gb"`
   - Debugging Shortcut: `"/usr/bin/flatpak" run org.libretro.RetroArch -v -L /gambatte_libretro.so "/run/media/mmcblk0p1/Emulation/roms/gb/Super Mario Land (World) (Rev 1).gb"`
   - Pasting the shortcut into `Kate` will make it easier to edit the shortcut for debugging purposes
2. Read the error, and see if it is providing valuable information. If it is an error code or something you do not understand, Google the error outputted

## Debugging by Resetting Configurations
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/EmuDeck/wiki/frequently-asked-questions#frequently-asked-questions-table-of-contents)

A valuable part of the EmuDeck application is a feature to reset emulators and Steam ROM Manager to EmuDeck's defaults. Resetting will revert global configurations but keep any configurations made on a per-game level. Uninstalling EmuDeck is almost never required to debug. 

To reset an emulator's configurations, switch to Desktop Mode, open EmuDeck, click the `Tools & Stuff` button at the bottom of the screen, and open the `Emulator Guides` page. 

**Tutorial**

1. Open EmuDeck on your desktop.
2. Click the `Tools & stuff` button at the bottom of the screen.
3. Click the `Emulator Guides` button.
4. Select which emulator configurations you would like to reset in the drop-down menu.
5. Click `Reset configuration`, wait a moment.
   1. Visual Reference (Using PCSX2 as an example): <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108900299/196877825-0a4fd76f-bed0-487a-95d5-5454e631f920.png" height="200">
6. Your selected emulator has been reset.
