## Update

### General Linux Compatibility
As of the latest update, this _should_ be compatible with most Linux systems, with the following limitations:
1. This will not operate on swap partitions, only files.
2. The Game Data and VRAM tabs will likely not work
3. Pop_OS! has a custom swappiness that will override any value set here after reboot.

Please keep in mind that support for non-Steam Deck devices is on a "best effort" basis, and will have a low priority.
Unfortunately, the amount of effort and support that would be needed to guarantee functionality for all distros would
require me to be working on this full-time, which is not the case.

If you want to use the tweaks here without relying on this tool, please see the "How Does it Work" section below.

### VRAM Tab
There's a new VRAM tab which will tell you the current "UMA Frame Buffer Size" setting, and how to configure it if
you haven't already!

### Swap Improvements
The swapfile path is now completely dynamic and the resize functionality can recover in the event of an earlier failure!
You no longer need to manually intervene if a previous swap resize failed, just run the resize again and it'll work its
magic.

### One-Click Game Data Cleanup
There's now a simple "Delete all uninstalled" button in the "Clean Game Data" window. Just click it and all the data
from uninstalled games will be removed! 

**Please keep in mind that non-cloud-saved save games should still be backed up manually before using this.**

for examples on how to use this and what performance you can expect.

## Install

### Simple

[Download this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CryoByte33/steam-deck-utilities/main/InstallCryoUtilities.desktop)
to your desktop (right click and save file) on your Steam Deck, then double-click it.

This will install the program, create desktop icons, and create menu entries.

### Manual

See [manual-install.md](https://github.com/CryoByte33/steam-deck-utilities/blob/main/docs/manual-install.md).

### Offline/Firewalled

In case you're in a firewalled country like China, please see [this post on my website](https://cryobyte.io/posts/2023/03/cryoutilities-offline-installation/)
for install directions and a non-GitHub download link.

## Usage

**NOTE:** This **REQUIRES** a password set on the Steam Deck. That can be done with the `passwd` command.

### GUI

After installation, just run the "CryoUtilities" icon on the desktop or the application menu under "Utilities".

### CLI

The latest version has a full CLI handler, which can be used to perform all tweaks, but doesn't perform game data
operations.

```
sudo ~/.cryo_utilities/cryo_utilities <command> [parameter]
```

If you want to see the available commands and accepted values, you can use:

```
sudo ~/.cryo_utilities/cryo_utilities help
```

**Note:** You _need_ to use sudo for the tweaks to work, otherwise it can't write to the necessary locations on disk.

## Upgrade

Double-click the "Update CryoUtilities" icon on the desktop, you will get a dialog box when the update is complete.

## Uninstall

Double-click the "Uninstall CryoUtilities" icon on the desktop, you will be asked if you're sure, then asked if you want
to revert the tweaks that have been made.

## Revert To Default Settings

To revert to the Steam Deck defaults, do one of the following:

* Boot CryoUtilities and click "Stock" on the homepage.
* Uninstall CryoUtilities, you'll be asked if you want to revert to stock settings. Choose yes.

After choosing these options, the Deck will be identical to an unmodified version.

## Known Issues

* If the drive becomes full during the swap file resize, you can trigger a known SteamOS bug that causes boot loops.
    * CryoUtilities is programmed in such a way to not allow this, but in the very worst cases it's still possible if
      something is operating/downloading in the background, at the same time CryoUtilities resizes the swap file.
    * In the event that it happens, you need to either get into a live environment and delete some files, or reinstall
      SteamOS with the non-destructive method.
* While using CLI mode, it is possible that the swap file resize takes long enough that the sudo credentials will time
  out.
    * This does not occur in GUI mode, due to how I was able to implement authentication, and will be patched out of
      CLI-only mode soon.

## FAQ

See [the FAQ page](https://github.com/CryoByte33/steam-deck-utilities/blob/main/docs/faq.md).

## What does it do?

See [the tweak explanation page](https://github.com/CryoByte33/steam-deck-utilities/blob/main/docs/tweak-explanation.md).

## Troubleshooting

### CryoUtilities doesn't appear after double-clicking the icon on the desktop

* Make sure that you're using SteamOS 3.4 or later
* Verify that `/home/deck/.cryo_utilities/cryo_utilities` and `/home/deck/.cryo_utilities/launcher.sh` exist
    * `/home/deck/.cryo_utilities` is a hidden directory, so ensure that you can view hidden files

If the above doesn't work, please open an issue here or contact in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ySe8WGVNPv)!

### I have instability in a game after using CryoUtilities' recommended settings

Try rebooting the Deck and trying again, I haven't heard of instability post-reboot, but if you find some please let
me know!

### Right-clicking the link to save it doesn't open a dialog box

Reboot the Deck or restart desktop mode, afterwards the link should work.

### The .desktop file just opens with KWrite after I download it.

Make sure the `CryoUtilities.desktop` file is on the desktop when you run it. If that still doesn't work, try one of the
following:

* Run `chmod +x ~/Downloads/InstallCryoUtilities.desktop` and then try again.
* Add `CryoUtilities.desktop` as a Non-Steam game and run it from Steam.

### The swap resize times out

Go to Game Mode, navigate to Settings > System, then press "Run storage device maintenance tasks" at the very bottom.
After it's completed, you should be able to resize the swap file easily.

### Trying to do anything crashes the program

Make sure that you installed using the installer. If you can't, then run:

```bash
chown -R deck:deck ~/.cryo_utilities
chmod -R 777 ~/.cryo_utilities
```

These permissions are more open than necessary, though, so only do it as a last resort.
