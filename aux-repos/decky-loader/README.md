## üìñ About

Decky Loader is a homebrew plugin launcher for the Steam Deck. It can be used to [stylize your menus](https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/SDH-CssLoader), [change system sounds](https://github.com/EMERALD0874/SDH-AudioLoader), [adjust your screen saturation](https://github.com/libvibrant/vibrantDeck), [change additional system settings](https://github.com/NGnius/PowerTools), and [more](https://plugins.deckbrew.xyz/).

For more information about Decky Loader as well as documentation and development tools, please visit [our wiki](https://deckbrew.xyz).

### üé® Features

üßπ Clean injecting and loading of multiple plugins.  
üîí Stays installed between system updates and reboots.  
üîó Allows two-way communication between plugins and the loader.  
üêç Supports Python functions run from TypeScript React.  
üåê Allows plugins to make fetch calls that bypass CORS completely.

### ü§î Common Issues

- Syncthing may use port 8080 on Steam Deck, which Decky Loader needs to function. If you are using Syncthing as a service, please change its port to something else.
- If you are using any software that uses port 1337 or 8080, please change its port to something else or uninstall it.
- Sometimes Decky will disappear on SteamOS updates. This can easily be fixed by just re-running the installer and installing the stable branch again. If this doesn't work, try installing the prerelease instead. If that doesn't work, then [check the existing issues](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/issues) and if there isn't one then you can [file a new issue](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBUG%5D+%3Ctitle%3E).

## üíæ Installation
- This installation can be done without an admin/sudo password set.
1. Prepare a mouse and keyboard if possible.
   - Keyboards and mice can be connected to the Steam Deck via USB-C or Bluetooth.
   - Many Bluetooth keyboard and mouse apps are available for iOS and Android. (KDE connect is preinstalled on the steam deck)
   - The Steam Link app is available on [Windows](https://media.steampowered.com/steamlink/windows/latest/SteamLink.zip), [macOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steam-link/id1246969117), and [Linux](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.valvesoftware.SteamLink). It works well as a remote desktop substitute.
   - If you have no other options, use the right trackpad as a mouse and press <img src="./docs/images/light/steam.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/steam.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16>+<img src="./docs/images/light/x.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/x.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16> to open the on-screen keyboard as needed.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Now that you have Decky Loader installed, you can start using plugins. Each plugin is maintained by a different developer and has its own uses, but most follow a general structure outlined below.

### üì¶ Plugins

1. Press the <img src="./docs/images/light/qam.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/qam.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16> button and navigate to the <img src="./docs/images/light/plug.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/plug.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16> icon. This is the Decky menu used for interacting with plugins and the loader itself.
1. Select the <img src="./docs/images/light/store.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/store.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16> icon to open the Plugins Browser. This is where you can find and install plugins.
   - You can also install from URL in the Settings menu. We do not recommend installing plugins from untrusted sources.
1. To install a plugin, select the "Install" button on the plugin you want. You can also select a version from a dropdown menu, but this is not recommended.
1. To update, uninstall, and reload plugins, navigate to the Decky menu and select the <img src="./docs/images/light/gear.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/gear.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16> icon.
   - Keep in mind that uninstalling a plugin will only remove its plugin files, not any other files it may have created.

### üõ†Ô∏è Plugin Development

There is no complete plugin development documentation yet. However a good starting point is the [plugin template repository](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-plugin-template). Consider [joining our Discord](https://deckbrew.xyz/discord) if you have any questions.

### ü§ù Contributing

Please consult [the wiki page regarding development](https://wiki.deckbrew.xyz/en/loader-dev/development) for more information on installing development versions of Decky Loader. You can also install the Steam Deck UI on a Windows or Linux computer for testing by following [this YouTube guide](https://youtu.be/1IAbZte8e7E?t=112).

1. Clone the repository using the latest commit to main before starting your PR.
1. In your clone of the repository, run these commands.
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm i
   pnpm run build
   ```
1. If you are modifying the UI, these commands will need to be run before deploying the changes to your Steam Deck.
1. Use the VS Code tasks or `deck.sh` script to deploy your changes to your Steam Deck to test them.
1. You will be testing your changes with the Python script version. You will need to build, deploy, and reload each time.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you are recieving build errors due to an out of date library, you should run this command inside of your repository.

```bash
pnpm update decky-frontend-lib --latest
```

Source control and deploying plugins are left to each respective contributor for the cloned repos in order to keep dependencies up to date.

## üìú Credits

The original idea for the plugin loader concept is based on the work of [marios8543's Steam Deck UI Inject project](https://github.com/marios8543/steamdeck-ui-inject).
