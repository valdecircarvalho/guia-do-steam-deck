# Roms Megathread

Aqui você encontrará links para vários sites onde pode conseguir baixar roms e bios para os emuladores. 

## Sites para baixar roms (Romsites)

Recomendo fortemente que você use um Ad Block no seu browser quando for acessar esses sites, assim você evitará clicar em links errados e falsos botões de download que aparecem em alguns sites.

???+ warning "ATENÇÃO"

    Tenha bastante cuidado em acessar alguns sites. Eu acessei e verifiquei todos os links abaixo, mas não posso garantir que algum deles possa ter vírus ou algo do tipo. A responsabilidade é toda sua.
