*****


###Required Components:
You will need to install some/all of these before downloading any games (legitimate or pirated!) to stop games crashing due to missing software on your computer:

- [DirectX](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)

- [VisualCppRedist AIO](https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist/releases/latest)

- [XNA Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914)

###Important must-have software/extensions.

- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) - for opening 7z/Rar archives. (Kind of made redundant as Windows will have native support for them soon.)

- [Parsec](https://parsec.app/) - play local multiplayer games from anywhere.

- [LogMeIn Hamachi](https://vpn.net) - Emulates LAN/Local internet connection, Basically a VPN for lan emulation. Similar to Parsec.

- [RadminVPN](https://www.radmin-vpn.com/) - SImilar to Hamachi, better choice for Windows users.

- [GGNTW - Steam Workshop Downloader](https://ggntw.com/steam)


###Game Search Engines
These are easy search engines to find your games.

 - [Rezi.one](https://rezi.one) **- Recommended for finding most games.** DDL Search Engine

 - [Custom Google-based Pirated Games Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=20c2a3e5f702049aa)

 - [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett) - Torrent search engine application.

 - [Hatt](https://github.com/FrenchGithubUser/Hatt) - DDL Search engine application.


###Torrent Sites
You will likely need a VPN to download torrents to avoid receiving Copyright notices from your ISP - unless, your country does not care about piracy. Read more in the VPN section further in this thread. Torrents are P2P downloads - you download from other people who have downloaded the file. No servers are involved.

 - [1337X](https://1337x.to/) - Do not download torrents from IGG Games. For linux, download from johncena141

 - [RuTor](http://www.rutor.info/)

 - [RuTracker](https://rutracker.org/)

 - [MacTorrents](https://www.torrentmac.net/) - macOS


**Torrent Software**

 - [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php)

 - [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/download/)

 - [Vuze](http://www.vuze.com/)

 - [LibreTorrent](https://github.com/proninyaroslav/libretorrent/releases/latest) - for Android devices.


###Direct Download Sites:
Direct Downloads are any normal download. You download the file from a server through a web browser. It is significantly safer to download this way and **you will not need a VPN.** In some cases, you will need a VPN to access blocked filehost sites (e.g. ZippyShare is blocked in some EU countries). It is recommended to use a Download Manager mentioned further down the Mega Thread to help manage your downloads.

**Note:- While most of the stuff on Archive.org, OldGamesDownload and MyAbandonware are safe, some can be unsafe too since the sources for the games there often have blurry lines! Please be careful when downloading anything from there!**
