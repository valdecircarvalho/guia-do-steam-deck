It can be used to [stylize your menus](https://github.com/suchmememanyskill/SDH-CssLoader), [change system sounds](https://github.com/EMERALD0874/SDH-AudioLoader), [adjust your screen saturation](https://github.com/libvibrant/vibrantDeck), [change additional system settings](https://github.com/NGnius/PowerTools), and [more](https://plugins.deckbrew.xyz/).

For more information about Decky Loader as well as documentation and development tools, please visit [our wiki](https://deckbrew.xyz).

### üé® Features

### ü§î Common Issues

- Syncthing may use port 8080 on Steam Deck, which Decky Loader needs to function. If you are using Syncthing as a service, please change its port to something else.
- If you are using any software that uses port 1337 or 8080, please change its port to something else or uninstall it.
- Sometimes Decky will disappear on SteamOS updates. This can easily be fixed by just re-running the installer and installing the stable branch again. If this doesn't work, try installing the prerelease instead. If that doesn't work, then [check the existing issues](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/issues) and if there isn't one then you can [file a new issue](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBUG%5D+%3Ctitle%3E).

## üíæ Installation
- This installation can be done without an admin/sudo password set.
1. Prepare a mouse and keyboard if possible.
   - Keyboards and mice can be connected to the Steam Deck via USB-C or Bluetooth.
   - Many Bluetooth keyboard and mouse apps are available for iOS and Android. (KDE connect is preinstalled on the steam deck)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Now that you have Decky Loader installed, you can start using plugins. Each plugin is maintained by a different developer and has its own uses, but most follow a general structure outlined below.

### üì¶ Plugins

Press the <img src="./docs/images/light/qam.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/qam.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16> button and navigate to the <img src="./docs/images/light/plug.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/plug.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16> icon. This is the Decky menu used for interacting with plugins and the loader itself.
1. Select the <img src="./docs/images/light/store.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/store.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16> icon to open the Plugins Browser. This is where you can find and install plugins.
   - You can also install from URL in the Settings menu. We do not recommend installing plugins from untrusted sources.
1. To install a plugin, select the "Install" button on the plugin you want. You can also select a version from a dropdown menu, but this is not recommended.
1. To update, uninstall, and reload plugins, navigate to the Decky menu and select the <img src="./docs/images/light/gear.svg#gh-dark-mode-only" height=16><img src="./docs/images/dark/gear.svg#gh-light-mode-only" height=16> icon.
   - Keep in mind that uninstalling a plugin will only remove its plugin files, not any other files it may have created.
